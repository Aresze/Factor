# factor
Function on kotlin, which will factorize the variable x and return an array of primes

The factorization algorithm is based on that if a number has a prime divisor other than itself,
then it does not exceed the root of the number.To calculate a number need to iterate over all the numbers in interval [2; âˆšx],
and try dividing x into them.
